Back a few months ago i tried writing this with the premise of making it full-fledged ie. with a balance account thatd you spend on tickets, time-based bankrolls and thousands of 'NPC's' rolling with you, self-regulating bank balance.

But, i got REALLY mad and burned out trying to write my own save logic, something about working with files in python just doesnt sit well with me. I picked it up again but this time not overshooting with my expectations - did what i had to do and did it well, i think

The focus was on expandability, hence so many 'eval()'s i didnt know how to work around, its just my way of making it as dynamic as i can. Plopping in a new game is just popping the class in and making the matching menu entry. The functions are so autistically dynamic that everything else _should_ work : )


Yeah we rollin
